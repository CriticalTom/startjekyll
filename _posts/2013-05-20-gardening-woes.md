I've been wanting to eat more roasted vegetables, because 1. they're delicious, 2. they're cheaper than meat, and 3. they're supposedly good for you (or so my Mom claims).

&nbsp;

Luckily, since my girlfriend and I had sowed an awesome garden, it wasn't going to take too long until I'd be roasting all the free vegetables I could gather.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, some little devilish creature who only comes out at night has ravaged my broccoli plant as well as my collard greens.  I'm pissed because it's never around when I am, so I can't find it and destroy it.  I assume it's some sort of caterpillar or slug, since it's eaten the leaves only.

&nbsp;

Anyways, my point is that I hated insects before and BREAKING NEWS: CHYRON UPDATE SCROLLS BY: I STILL FUCKING DO!

&nbsp;

So you can take your <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22508439">report</a>, U.N., and shove it.  My first-world ass isn't eating any damn insects, even if it will help world hunger.  I refuse to admit insects are a vital part of the food chain, and am going to continue to consider them a persona non grata, enemy number 1 in my mind.
