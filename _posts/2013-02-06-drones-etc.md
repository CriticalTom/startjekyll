Since everybody needs to give their opinion on the Justice Department's white paper regarding drone strikes on American citizens, I thought I would too.  Spoiler alert: I'm against drone strikes because I'm also against murdering people, in a general sense.

Anyways, I don't think I could have done as good of a takedown as the wonderful writers over at <a href="http://www.popehat.com/">Popehat</a>, so instead I'll just direct you to this <a href="http://www.popehat.com/2013/02/05/did-someone-mention-consistency/">link</a> where you can read their terse, dark-comedy commentary.  My own opinions mirror theirs.
