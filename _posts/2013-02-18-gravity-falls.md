I'm not naturally a huge fan of cartoons, although there are a few I've enjoyed.  But I never watched Saturday morning cartoons as a kid, and never read any American comic books (I did read Tin-Tin and Asterix, as well as the strips in the paper).

&nbsp;

I'm telling you this so that you know I'm serious when I say that Gravity Falls is a great show.  I don't care that it's ostensibly a kid's show, or that it's on Disney - the plots are engaging and it's shockingly able to tug at my heartstrings.

&nbsp;

I only started watching because 2 members of the Grandma's Virginity Podcast did guest voices on the show, but now that I've seen a few episodes, I'll have to watch them all.  I also really dig the voice acting of Kristen Schaal as the second lead character.
