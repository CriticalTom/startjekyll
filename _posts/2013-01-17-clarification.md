Thanks to the illustrious <a title="mustache" href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/01/17/how-to-start-a-blog/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> (who I admire despite his spelling of the word "moustache") , I'll now be authoring posts as "Tom" instead of "Admin."

&nbsp;

However, in the unlikely event I become some sort of Christ-like, messianic figure later in life, I will clarify that I wrote all the previous posts as well.Â  I don't want them to get buried like the lost gospels of Mary or whatever.
