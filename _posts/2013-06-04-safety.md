I was at at meeting where an employee of a large defense contractor was showing some slides of what their company does.  All I can think of is the fact that everything's central purpose is to kill.  The defense contractor apologies for the noise his company's death machines make as they take off from the nearby base.  There's a few chuckles.  A bit disgusting, really.

"Makes me feel safe!" someone yells from the back.

I'm pretty sure I'd rather be a chimp than a human.
