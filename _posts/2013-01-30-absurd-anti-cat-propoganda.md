Look, I'm fine with the fact that some people just aren't cat people.  I am a cat person.  Do I live with a cat? No, I live with a dog.  And I love my dog very much, as well as her displaced brother.  But that doesn't mean I'm not a cat person.

&nbsp;

I'm not sure if I ever <em>will</em> keep a cat, because it's difficult to keep both a cat and a dog while keeping the dog happy, and I can't imagine living without a dog any more.  But that doesn't mean I'm not a cat person.

&nbsp;

Part of the reason I love my dog so much is her unabashed carnivorism, especially compared to some of her contemporaries whose genes have been warped to the point they probably couldn't catch a single other animal - I'm not even sure some dog breeds (pugs?) are even aware that they're <em>supposed</em> to have a hunting instinct; that they're still almost entirely wolf.  And this love for my dog explains why I'm a cat person.

&nbsp;

Most cats look almost the same.  There are a few distinct breeds but the majority of them still retain their original instincts and abilities.  A big part of this is the fact that few people breeds their cats purposefully; rather, their indoor/outdoor cat interbreeds with a nearby feral cat colony in a way that continually replenishes households with little mutt kittens.  In this way, their original nature remains.

&nbsp;

But then people conduct absurd <a title="cat study" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21236690">studies</a> demonizing my beloved cats for the very reason I love them!  Oh, they kill billions of creatures each year in the U.S.?  Yeah, I know, exactly, they're fucking bad-ass.  They don't just look like miniature lions, they fucking are.  They are responsible for the extinction of 33 species?  First of all, cats, slow your roll, this ain't a contest and if it was humans could win.  Second of all, that's a respectable number for 15-pound felines.

&nbsp;

<em>(Also, seriously people, please don't declaw your cats.  Also, if you want them to lead long, healthy lives, they should probably live indoors only.  Even if you don't live close to a road, there's always hawks and coyotes waiting to eat cats.  Make sure you weigh those factors when deciding to let them roam - I'm not completely against it, but it's usually most appropriate for farms where they'll just shuttle themselves between the barn and the house.)</em>
