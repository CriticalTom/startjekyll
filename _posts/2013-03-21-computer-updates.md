Ok, a few notes from the computer front.

&nbsp;

First, I revived my girlfriend's old netbook.  I had planned on installing, and in fact did install, Windows 8.  What a fucking mistake that was!  It turns out, Microsoft is uninterested in supporting netbooks at all with their operating systems, and therefore were unconcerned that most of the Metro gadgetry didn't work on the standard netbook screen resolution.  Luckily, I was able to install Windows 7 after the fact with no problems, and the netbook is now doing great.

&nbsp;

Second, I slowly started to get annoyed with Unity on my laptop, on which was installed Ubuntu 12.10.  I tried some work-arounds regarding the Amazon search feature within the Unity bar, but then Ubuntu started giving me errors quite regularly.  Besides all this, the laptop hails from 2006, and I wasn't really getting much benefit from having a feature-laden operating system installed.  So I decided to swap out Ubuntu for Lubuntu, which includes fewer default programs and uses the LXDE desktop.

&nbsp;

I must say that I consider Lubuntu a great product, and in fact I'm considering using it in all locations instead of Ubuntu.  I've still got access to the same repository, and I never found I was using most of the default programs, anyways.  It's not a huge deal to just install what I need when I need it.  The eye-candy factor isn't really there, but it doesn't bother me on my laptop - and would it even bother me on my desktop?  Now I'm not so sure...

&nbsp;

...Well, I could always add <em>yet another</em> partition to play around in...
