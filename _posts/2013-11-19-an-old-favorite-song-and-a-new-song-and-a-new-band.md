I used to love the the song "<a title="Tell your story walking" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfkGN3Nd9q4" target="_blank">Tell your story walking</a>," by Deb Talan.Â  I mean, I still do, but I used to, too (sorry, Mitch...).

&nbsp;

Well, I just learned she was in a band (?!)... I have no idea how I missed that.

&nbsp;

Now I'm listening to this song by Deb's band The Weepies titled "<a title="Gotta have you" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBD750Fsz4" target="_blank">Gotta have you</a>," and thinking of my special someone (not because we fight on the phone, but just because I miss her, and the song is cute!)
