I'm in a conference in Baltimore, MD.  While I'll admit I've only seen about 7 city blocks, I've loved those blocks.  The buildings are classic American, and extend all the way to the waterfront, which is (from a distance) clean and full of museum-ships.  The weather is nice and cool, with a healthy breeze coming in from the harbor. I've decided Baltimore is more than just that-city-next-to-D.C.

It's also highlighted how devastating Atlanta's lack of waterfront is to my enjoyment of the city.  Without a waterfront, or equally impressive scenery, it's hard to really enjoy walking around town.
