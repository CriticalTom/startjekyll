Look I don't want to sound like Jay Leno so I'll try to not do this too often.  But holy shit, "<a title="norway goat cheese fire" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21141244">Norway goat cheese fire closes tunnel</a>????"  I guess my main question is if cheese can burn so well, why doesn't this happen more often?

Second is the Irish, who've decided <a title="irish drunk" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21143199">older folks should be allowed to drive drunk</a>, so as to not ruin their social lives.  I guess the alternative of not drinking, staying overnight, or taking other transportation never occurred to the senile shut-ins, which says enough about their ability to drive even while sober.  In fairness, the relaxed BAC standard would only be lifted to the United States and UK's BAC limit, so it'd be hypocritical to call the Irish drunks because of this law change.

In other news, I'm googling furiously to find healthy, relatively inexpensive snacks to take to work.  I can't seem to make it using only lunchtime, but I can't just eat nuts all day because I get sick of them too quickly.  I tried pumpkin seeds but that went from delectable to dull pretty quickly.  Hummus and Naan is delicious but buying it pre-made is too expensive, and I've not yet been successful in making hummus of my own that I enjoy eating.  I mean c'mon what's a guy gotta do around here to get some appropriate snacks, ya know? Sheesh.
