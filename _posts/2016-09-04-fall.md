Fall has finally come to Georgia, which means it's only hot, not unbearably so. There's a chance, depending on my graduation date and my job search, this could be my last fall in Georgia.

The uncertainty of a job hunt is killer and has barely begun. The uncertainty of whether this is my last experience of something or not is killer.

That's about it. I should update my resume.
