Here's something that's probably been said better by others, but it's been bugging me for the past month(s).

&nbsp;

Y'all do realize that by saying, "the worst homophobes are Republican congressmen who are secretly just repressed, in-the-closet gay men" is basically equivalent to saying, "no true straightÂ  person hates gay people- only other gay people do that!"

&nbsp;

Cool story bro, so lemme get this straight - in this scenario, gay people are causing all their own problems, so straight people don't need to worry at all? Awesome, I'm sure that's EXACTLY the situation, no need for any empathy then - they're doing it to themselves, you see! How convenient for you to blame all the problems of a marginalized group squarely on their own shoulders.

Terrible viewpoint, totally inaccurate, sick of hearing it. I feel like I hear it less now than I used to (good) but I still probably hear it way more often than I should. It's dumb to even write this post because it should be obvious but it's clearly not because I keep hearing that viewpoint and it scrapes my soul more each time.
