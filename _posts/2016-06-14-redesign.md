I've re-designed the website to a static one, based on Jekyll. The comments are handled by disqus.

There will be tweaking of prior work (there are, I believe, a few bugs to be ironed out) and defintely changes made to the layout. Hopefully, this will prove to be a easier platform than Wordpress to keep, uh, free from the influences of malcontents.

Incidentally, I've based this (current as of today) theme on a [tutorial by Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).

The posts need to be written in markdown which is not my preference but I may configure a text editor to be wysiwyg markdown-generating instead of struggling manually.
