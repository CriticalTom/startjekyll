I knew a woman in my graduate studies who would phrase her questions, "well, between choice A and choice B.... which one is better?"  This was a class on the legal issues in the life cycle of a business, and it gave a broad overview of common issues.  Of course the answer to <em>every</em> question was the same: it depends.  In some circumstances, A.  In others, B.  Without knowing a specific situation (and usually, without the benefit of hindsight) it will be impossible to tell.  If choice A was always correct, do you think choice B would even exist - or would our professor teach it? It's safe to say, probably not.

I'm still confused as to her thought process.  Was she expecting an actual answer, or just asking to participate in the discussion?  If the latter, I understand, yet I would have preferred questions that actually advanced the discussion, not that led to the dead end of "it depends."  You can't pick your classmates, though.
