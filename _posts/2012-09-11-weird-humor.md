Perhaps you've heard of "<a href="http://www.channel101.com/episode/270">House of Cosbys</a>."  If not, I've linked the first episode.  It was a Channel 101 show. The pilot episode is one of the finest 5 minutes of cartoon I've ever seen.

&nbsp;

I've been a huge fan of its creator, Justin Roiland, every since hearing his podcast "<a href="http://grandmasvirginity.libsyn.com/">Grandma's Virginity Podcast</a>" (co-hosted with Ryan Ridley and Jackie Buscarino).

Probably my sense of humor isn't all that normal.
