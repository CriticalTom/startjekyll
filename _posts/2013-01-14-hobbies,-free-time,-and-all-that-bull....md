I have a few things I do which I'd consider hobbies.  But I don't know why I do them.

&nbsp;

I enjoy my hobbies... but probably not as much as I'd enjoy sitting on my ass playing a video game, or watching a movie.  I tell myself I can save money - for example, with woodworking - but because whatever I make typically ends up inferior to what I could buy, that's probably not true.  I never have a cohesive plan for how to get better, but I do stress out about neglecting to grow my skills.  I do enough woodworking to consider it an active hobby, but not enough to warrant admiration from other people.  My other hobbies are more nebulous - does getting black shit on my clothes while trying to tune my bike count?  The real derailleur's action still isn't perfect, which is embarrassing considering how much time I've spent trying to fine-tune it.  Does building a raised garden bed but never planting anything in it count as gardening, construction, or nothing at all?

&nbsp;

I suppose my complaint is that the only thing I'm good enough to make money at, I'm already doing as my job.  And I don't make very much money, anyways.  It's not a great prospect.  Shouldn't I be using my free time to cultivate something which will allow me to live an easier life?  And if that's not possible, shouldn't I just maximize my relaxation, by mindlessly sitting in front of a computer playing a game?

&nbsp;

I want to use my free time correctly, but I just don't know how.
